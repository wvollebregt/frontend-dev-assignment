## de Bijenkorf Frontend Dev assignment

This project allows de Bijenkorf to assess potential frontend candidates with real, working code.

It is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to give you the initial setup.

If you are not familiar with Create React App you can find an up to date guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Exercises

You will find the **exercises and associated instructions** in separate named folders(exercise-1, exercise-2, etc.) in the root of this project. **Follow the instructions in the folders and complete the exercises one by one**. Try not to spend more than **8 hours**. 


## Folder Structure

The initial project structure looks like this:

```
frontend-dev-assignment/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
    manifest.json
  src/
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    registerServiceWorker.js
```

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
